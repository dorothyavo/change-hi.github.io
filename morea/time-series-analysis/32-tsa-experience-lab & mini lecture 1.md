 What is a Time Series?

 Time Series: is a collection of observations indexed by time.

 The observations each occur at some time t, where t belongs to the set of allowed times, T.

Time Series Model for a Time Series { Xt }: is a specification of the joint probability distribution of the model. 

A time series will have a defined and finite mean (except in special cases):

What is Time Series Analysis?



Why do some data have seasonal changes?

# LAB
 Decomposition: separating trends, seasonality, and residuals/remainders

 Seasonal subseries plots and lag plots.
 
 Detrending: removing trends using differencing.
 
 Outlier detection and handling.
